*** Sample app setup
    - Trying to specify the rails version gave me the following error;
      so I didn't specify a version, and everything seemed to work.
      ~/repos $ rails _4.2.2_ new sample
       /home/kwaku/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/dependency.rb:315:in `to_specs': Could not find 'railties' (= 4.2.2) - did find: [railties-4.2.4,railties-4.2.3,railties-4.2.1,railties-4.1.4] (Gem::LoadError)

    - The Gemfile retained the default version numbers generated by Rails.
      The idea is if there's a version snag later, fix it and report it.
